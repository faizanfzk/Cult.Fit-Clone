# Cult.fit-Clone
This repository is about our group project for unit III construct week. We all have ordered food online from food delivery companies like Swiggy or Zomato in India. Similar to that in this project we had to build a clone of cult.fit website that provides fresh food delivery service all across the major cities in India.
